I enjoy making things/apps/tools/programs/experiences. Iâ€™m currently working on various projects - most recently diving into a deeper understanding of web development, exploring html, css, and JS best practices, and utilizing Python's Flask/Jinja/SQLAlchemy framework and SQLite3 built in database. Within these repositories, you can find various programs to perform statistical calculations - regressions, z/t scores, Bayesian statistics, univariate, descriptive statistics, EDA, etc, as well as a Kivy Report generation program to search for recently modified or unused files on a Unix system. It is my hope that others will find enjoyment or usefulness in my work.

Currently, I'm focused on learning OOP fundamentals, internalizing programming best practices, building cool things and sharing my work with others.
