Hi,

I enjoy making things/app/tools/experiences with python. Iâ€™m currently working on various python programs - most recently utilizing Python's Flask/Jinja/SQLAlchemy framework and SQLite built in database. Within my repositories, you can find various programs to perform statistical calculations - regressions, z/t scores, Bayesian statistics, univariate, descriptive statistics, EDA, etc, as well as a Kivy Report generation program to search for recently modified or unused files on a Unix system. It is my hope that others will find enjoyment or usefulness in my work.

I am always learning and doing. Currently, I'm focused on learning OOP fundamentals, internalizing programming best practices, building cool things and sharing my work with others.
