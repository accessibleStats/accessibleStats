Hi, I’m @accessibleStats.

I’m interested in making statistics accessible and fun for students in higher education. 
I’m currently learning to develop python programs that automate and help teach statistics fundamentals. Currently, I am exploring memory allocation 
techniques, the efficient use of system resources, local vs global variables, and nesting functions.

I’m looking to learn and collaborate on statistical analysis or educational projects.

Reach me at jack.nickelson@outlook.com. I love to chat all things python, R, pedagogy, and stats.
